            <p class="article-text"> The next spot I want to share is an eye-sore to some, but beautiful to others. It’s called <strong> Panna II Garden </strong> and it is in the East Village. Panna II Garden is an Indian restaurant with what I think is great food (although I have also heard the contrary), but what tends to draw people to this restaurant is the decor. Panna II Garden has Christmas lights hung year-round and they are constantly on. Now this may not seem that strange, but the amount of lights there are is the kicker. From the outside of the restaurant, you can see strings and strings of lights hanging in from of the windows, but you see the real magic once you step inside. The lights are strung so thick that it is practically impossible to see the ceiling, if at all, but this chaotic decor makes for a very fun environment. As well as that, almost everything on the menu is less than $20, including the entrees, and I have leftovers every time. This restaurant is also great for big parties and an added bonus is that you can BYOB, which I consider a saved cost. To top it all off, at the end of your meal, you are given a complimentary scoop of vanilla ice cream which, for whatever reason, always puts me in a good mood. </p>
