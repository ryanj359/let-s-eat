            <p class="article-text"> Alas, we have come to the end of the list. The final restaurant. They call it <strong> Jerrell’s Betr Brgr </strong>. Jerrell’s has one location in SoHo and another new location in Hoboken. Jerrell’s is one of my go-to late-night foods, but because of that I actually have never been to the restaurant in person, I have only ordered it. So, I can’t speak on the ambiance of the place itself from experience, but from the photos online it seems like there is outdoor seating and a window to order from. What makes Jerrell’s stand out from many other burger restaurants in the city is that it is an entirely vegan restaurant, and it has fair prices. Depending on what you get, a burger can range from $9 to $16 and they are absolutely delicious. Jerrell’s also has other snacks like fries, chili fries, oat milk soft serve, and oat milk milkshakes. I prefer Jerrell’s as my late-night food of choice because I can get the same satisfaction as a regular burger but without that cement-like feeling that most greasy foods leave in your stomach. Jerrell’s is an amazing option, especially for those who have dietary restrictions that don’t allow them to eat at most late-night places. It’s also just damn good. </p>
