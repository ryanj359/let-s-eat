            <p class="article-text"> Almost every restaurant I have been to in New York City claims to have the best happy hour, but so far I have only been to one restaurant where I can agree with that claim. Now, happy hour is definitely not a necessity, but such a big part of my experience living here is going out and socializing with friends, and that normally tends to happen at restaurants. Because of that, I am always on the prowl for an affordable happy hour so I can keep up with my current social life while not instantly regretting it when I see the bill. <strong>A10 Kitchen</strong> is my favorite happy hour in the city. Of course, I haven’t tried every single happy hour option in New York City, but of the ones I have tried, I would pick A10 Kitchen over any of them. A10 Kitchen is in East Village and has a fairly small indoor dining area, but lots of tables outside. Their happy hour times differ by day, but they normally span from around 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. During this time you can get a variety of different things at a lower price than normal; they have a few pitcher options which range from $20 to $30 and will serve about 4 to 7 drinks per pitcher. They also have a few food options to choose from such as pretzel bites, a burger, and more all for $12 or less. So, if you don’t drink, or maybe just aren’t in the mood, at A10 Kitchen’s happy hour you can still get a fairly reasonably priced meal. </p>
