            <p class="article-text"> Unfortunately, not every restaurant will give you free dessert like Panna II Garden, so when I’m craving a sweet treat I always end up at <strong> Veniero’s </strong>. Veniero’s is an East Village staple and has been since 1894; it is the ultimate dessert hub. It might be possible to count every dessert on the menu, but I bet no one can name them all. There are so many (sometimes too many) options to choose from and every single thing I have had from there has been phenomenal. Veniero’s doesn’t have any deals that I am aware of, but they really don’t need to because close to everything on the menu is less than $10. You have the option to get your treat at the counter and go on your way, or you can make your way past the line, around the counter, and sit in the restaurant. The times that I have been have always been a little crowded, but I don’t mind because the people who are surrounding you are also having a little dessert or coffee so for the most part everyone is in a good mood. Veniero’s is also great at making custom cakes. I have gotten a few from them and not only are they delicious, but in my opinion, $30 for a full-size custom cake (which can sometimes be done in 24 hours) is not too shabby. </p>
