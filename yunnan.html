            <p class="article-text"> Now let’s talk lunch. There are endless lunch spots in the city, but it seems that the average price for even just a salad is upwards of $20 and, to me, is not that filling. As someone who tends to eat dinner on the later side, I have to be full after I eat lunch so it lasts me until dinner. When I came across <strong> Yunnan Rice Noodle House </strong> located in Chinatown, I was over the moon. The restaurant has a nice feel to it with several tables and booths inside. Yunnan Rice Noodle House has tons of snacks and appetizers to choose from as well as beverages including the popular Chinese drink, Wanglaoji. But what Yunnan Rice Noodle House is known for is its rice noodle soup. You can choose from around eight different broths which are all about $12 to $15, but the best part - you can get unlimited refills on rice noodles, for free! The soup comes in a steaming hot bowl so the broth stays warm the entire time. I love coming here because I can get an entire filling meal and still have extra to take home. But, this doesn’t only have to be a lunch spot. They are open from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 a.m. every day, so if you ever have a late-night craving for rice noodles and don't want to break the bank, this is the spot for you. </p>
