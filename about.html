            <p id="aboutText"> When I first moved to New York City at 18 years old, I didn’t have a care in the world; I was living in my own place in a new city and I truly felt like I could do anything. That lasted about three days. Reality inevitably set in and I realized I had to be deliberate about everything I did, especially spending. Food was my biggest cost, that I could control, so I decided that I would learn to cook. It felt like the best way to eat affordably in the city, and I’m not saying it isn’t, but for someone who didn’t know the first thing about cooking I ended up making more inedible food than edible. Two years later I have learned how to make a few things (mainly pasta, soup, or something frozen), but I have also found some great places to eat out affordably. So, if you’re a student on a budget, don’t know how to cook, or, like me, both, you might find this helpful. </p>

            <p id="aboutText"> All in all, New York City can be a very daunting place for someone on a budget, especially when it comes to eating out. But, one of the best things about living here is that you will never run out of options. I have two pieces of advice for how to broaden your options: one, walk around and go into places you have never tried before because the odds are high that you will be decently surprised. And two, just ask people. I bet everyone has at least one go-to restaurant that is worth giving a shot. The next thing you know, you’ll have a list of restaurants in your Notes app that you can’t wait to try out. </p>
