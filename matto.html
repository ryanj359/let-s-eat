            <p class="article-text"> Let’s start out with the alleged “most important meal of the day,” breakfast. In the moment a $7 coffee might not seem terrible, but if you get one five days out of the week, you’re already clocking in at $35 - just for coffee! My suggestion would be to try out <strong> Matto Espresso </strong>. Matto Espresso has 30 locations in the city, most of them being in Manhattan. So far I have only been to the Greenwich Village location. It’s not a café that you can sit down at, but it is about a two-minute walk away from Washington Square Park if you prefer to sit and enjoy what you bought. Not only is Matto Espresso close to campus and convenient to go to before an early morning class, but I have never been somewhere with better prices. There are two ways to get a deal here; one way is to show your student ID card and another is to order through their app (Matto Coffee). When you do one of those two things, everything on the menu becomes $2.50. Everything. My go-to order is a chai latte and a croissant, but they also have a few breakfast sandwiches, other pastries, and some grab-and-go options. Mattoo Espresso has been a true savior to my bank account.</p>
